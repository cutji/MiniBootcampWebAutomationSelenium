# MiniBootcampWebAutomationSelenium

This project is an implementation of web automation using Selenium for a mini bootcamp. The project aims to learn and practice basic techniques in web automation testing using Selenium WebDriver.

## Features

- **Automated Testing**: Perform automated testing on web applications by controlling browsers directly.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Use Selenium to perform end-to-end testing on web-based applications.
- **Test Case Examples**: Several test case examples to understand basic automation flows, such as form filling and page navigation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK version 8 or higher.
- **Maven**: For managing project dependencies.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: To control browsers during testing.
- **Browser**: Selenium supports various browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and others.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cutji/MiniBootcampWebAutomationSelenium.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd MiniBootcampWebAutomationSelenium
   ```

3. Install dependencies with Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

4. Make sure you have the WebDriver for the browser you intend to use (e.g., [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)) and place it in your PATH.

## Usage

To run the tests, you can use the Maven command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will execute the automated test scripts prepared in this project.
